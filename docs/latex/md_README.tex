mth is a maths library built around expression template classes to work with objects such as vectors, matrices and quaternions, with helper classes to deal with solving equations. No guarantees of stability or quality so be warned.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{Building\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
To build from source, you will need cmake and a c++ compiler supporting c++17.

First, clone the repo and run cmake\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ git clone https://github.com/Luminiscental/mth}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ cd mth \&\& mkdir build \&\& cd build}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ cmake .. \# Optionally pass -\/DTESTS=ON to run tests when building}
\end{DoxyCode}
 Then run the generated build files, on mac/linux there should be a Makefile in the build directory that you can run with {\ttfamily make}. On windows there should be a Visual Studio solution file {\ttfamily mth.\+sln}; open this and build the solution.

After building there should be a {\ttfamily libmth.\+a} or {\ttfamily mth.\+lib} file for linking into programs that use mth.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Documentation\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
